In todayâ€™s world, parking management has become a significant challenge, especially in busy urban areas and institutions like schools and offices. Efficient parking systems not only help in organizing vehicles but also ensure a smoother experience for users.

This system allows users to add new vehicles, remove them, view parked vehicles, and check the availability of parking spaces in real time.
